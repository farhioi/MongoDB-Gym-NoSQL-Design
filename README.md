# MongoDB-Gym-NoSQL-Design

## Project Summary

This project involves the design and implementation of a document-based **NoSQL database** using **MongoDB Atlas**. The database is modeled to handle dynamic gym operations data, with a focus on flexible schema design, efficient data retrieval, and analytical reporting.

This repository demonstrates expertise in handling unstructured/semi-structured data and leveraging MongoDB's powerful aggregation framework.

## Core Skills Demonstrated

| Skill Area | Description & Implementation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **NoSQL Design & Modeling** | Document-based data modeling to support dynamic, non-relational data structures typical in modern application backend environments. |
| **Data Aggregation** | Use of **MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines** to process and transform data (e.g., calculating totals, grouping data) for analytical purposes. |
| **Data Visualization** | Utilization of **MongoDB Charts** to visualize operational data, offering rapid insights into gym performance metrics. |
| **CRUD Operations** | Proficiency in essential Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing gym data efficiently. |

## Repository Contents

The included files document the entire process from setup to data analysis:

* **`KuntosaliDB_Raportti.pdf`**: The full project report detailing the database model, aggregation queries, setup process, and analytical findings.
* **`aggregation_queries.js`**: (If available) Scripts or files containing the complex MongoDB aggregation pipelines used for reporting.
* **`schema_design.json`**: (If available) A sample structure or schema detailing the document models chosen.

## Setup & Running

This project utilized MongoDB Atlas (a cloud service).

1.  **Review the Report:** Begin by reviewing **`KuntosaliDB_Raportti.pdf`** to understand the document structure and the implemented analytical queries.
2.  **Access Data:** (If applicable) Use the provided connection details/scripts to connect to the MongoDB instance.
3.  **Run Aggregations:** Execute the aggregation queries to reproduce the analytical reports and visualizations created in MongoDB Charts.

This project highlights the ability to manage and analyze data outside the traditional relational model.
